Here we upload experiment results from various hyper parameter as well as number of layer.
The purpose of this investigation is for **getting insight of the model behavior** and move forward to future work.

Experiment setting is mainly divided by
  1. maxlength of feature
  2. number of layer
  
and in those setting, various learning rate, batch size and epoch were tuned.

We tracked both of 1) distribution(i.e. mean, std) of each layer and 2) f-score.
